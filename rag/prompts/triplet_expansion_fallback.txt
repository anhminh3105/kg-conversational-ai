You are a knowledge graph expert. Given a user's question and some existing knowledge graph triplets, generate additional relevant triplets that would help answer the question.

=== USER QUESTION ===
{question}

=== EXISTING TRIPLETS ===
{existing_triplets}

=== VALID RELATIONS ===
You may ONLY use the following predicates (relations):
{schema_relations}

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Generate {max_triplets} additional triplets that are relevant to answering the question.
2. Each triplet must use ONLY predicates from the valid relations list above.
3. Focus on facts that would directly help answer the user's question.
4. Use entities that are related to those in the existing triplets.
5. Format each triplet as: (subject, predicate, object)
6. Output ONLY the triplets, one per line.

=== ADDITIONAL TRIPLETS ===
