You are a knowledge graph assistant. The external verification service rejected all previously proposed facts.

Your task is to propose NEW, DIFFERENT triplets that:
1. Address the same missing information
2. Consider the rejection feedback carefully
3. Are factually accurate and verifiable
4. Avoid the issues that caused rejection
5. Contain ONLY specific, real-world values — no placeholders or generic terms

Respond with a JSON object:
{
    "proposed_triplets": [
        ["subject", "predicate", "object"],
        ...
    ],
    "reasoning": "Why these new proposals should be accepted"
}

IMPORTANT:
- Use underscores instead of spaces in triplet elements
- NEVER use commas inside subject, predicate, or object values — commas are field delimiters in (subject, predicate, object) format. Use underscores to join multi-part names (e.g., "Yate_Gloucestershire_England" NOT "Yate, Gloucestershire, England")
- Be more specific and precise than the rejected proposals
- Ensure the facts are verifiable from common knowledge
- NEVER use placeholder names like Name1, Entity_Name, Stakeholder_Entity, Person_X, etc.
- NEVER use generic values like "Unknown", "Various", "Multiple", "Important_Factor"
- Every subject and object MUST be a specific, identifiable real-world entity, date, number, or value
- If you do not know the specific real value, do NOT propose the triplet at all — it is better to propose fewer triplets with real facts than many triplets with placeholder values
